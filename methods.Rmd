## Methods for Developing COVID Models

**Background:**

The initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic indicated exponential growth potential both worldwide and locally. This suggests that without intervention, the infections would grow and then decay exponentially. This has sparked the motivation for instituting efforts to “flatten the curve”. While multiple efforts have been made to predict the long-term trajectory of COVID-19, using deterministic and stochastic based methods, they all require heavy assumptions with unknown accuracy. As we learn more about the etiology of the disease and its transmissibility, these long-term models will be refined.
Although long-term forecasting is evolving, short-term forecasting using basic assumptions are critical for documenting and identifying changes in our trajectory. These short-term models can assist us with monitoring the impact of implementing and relaxing health mandates to inform our public health efforts; simply put, we can monitor how things are progressing.


**Methods:**

We modeled the short term epidemic trajectory using a log-linear model under the form:

log(y) = r*t+b

Where, ‘y’ is the daily incidence, ‘t’ is the time in days from the start of the outbreak, ‘r’ is the growth rate, and ‘b’ is the origin or intercept. 

Assuming that without mitigation efforts the disease will spread at an exponential rate, we modeled the observed daily case counts over a 14-day period based on date of onset, and projected out 17 days. Due to delays in identification, reporting, confirmation, and natural history of the disease, illness occurring in recent days may not be fully documented yet. To account for this delay, we truncated the 14-day analysis window back one week (seven days). This truncation is necessary due to incomplete information on onset date that is prevalent during this early window, and guards against creating models that produce biased trajectories.

We truncated by seven days, due to the median duration from onset date to report date being approximately 6 days and attenuating in recent weeks. However, even with truncation, the results could be biased in the slope of the trajectory. The distribution of unknown onset date over the past 20 days however has remained fairly constant at nearly 2 cases per day. 

We used the most recent 14-day period – the 7-day truncation to project out 17 days (14 day’s beyond the last report date). The use of this 14 day window for the statewide estimate was chosen by convention with short-term projections, where the assumption is that more recent trends likely better approximate the current trajectory. 


**Interpretation:**

The first plot is based on daily incremental incidence counts often called the epidemic curve. The second plot  is the daily additive counts of new cases, or cumulative incidence. Both plots use the date of onset, and if onset is unknown we use the report date. We’ve used gray bars (epidemic curve plot) and gray dots (cumulative incidence plot) to denote the truncated date from the model fit.

Generally, when the daily epidemic curve plot trajectory is decreasing, this means the number of new daily onset cases is getting smaller, suggesting the mitigation strategies are having an impact or the disease is dying out. Likewise, when the cumulative incidence trajectory flattens and appears more linear, this indicates a reduction in the number of new cases added to the total each day. 

The difference in confidence bands (indicated by the gray band) are related to the amount of variability between the numbers. With cumulative case counts much less variability is observed compared to daily case counts, resulting in less residual error between observationsand smaller bands.  

These short term forecasts will update daily and project an estimated exponential trajectory. As daily observations divert below the projection this implies the mitigation efforts are working, as mandates are relaxed we can watch if our observations begin increasing along the exponential curve and adjust our efforts.
